# SmithLabArray
This package was developed by Tim Rayner at the CIMR (Smith Lab) but has disappeared from CRAN/Bioconductor. Adding latest stable release to my page for anyone in the group to use. 

# Installing
The easiest way to use this package is first by installing devtools (this allows direct installation of R packages from github) which is here: https://github.com/hadley/devtools

Next, just run:
devtools::install_github("pjshort/SmithLabArray")

If you get the following error: "Error in available_packages(repos, type) : lazy-load database 'P' is corrupt", then close your R session, re-open and try again.
